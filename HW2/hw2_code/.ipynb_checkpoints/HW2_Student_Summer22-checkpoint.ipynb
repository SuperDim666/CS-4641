You may use either Latex,  markdown, or any word processing software. <font color = 'darkred'>We will **NOT** accept handwritten work. </font> Make sure that your work is formatted correctly, for example submit $\\sum_{i=0} x_i$ instead of \\text{sum\\_\\{i=0\\} x\\_i}\n",

    "Rob Boss, after being stuck in his dorm for multiple nights finishing Homework 1 for his Machine Learning class, decides to get some well deserved fresh air. He plans on visiting the colorful birds festival downtown this weekend with a few friends. Once there, he takes many pictures and ultimately decides that his favorite is the picture attached below (please compliment Rob on his photography and machine learning skills the next time you see him) and wants to hang it up in his dorm. He decides to commission his artist friend to convert his picture into a painting but finds out his friend charges him for each color used when painting. Being the cash-strapped college student he is, help Rob build a KMeans clustering algorithm that can help him decide how many colors he wants to commission for his painting so that he can see the feather colors without spending too much money."

    "- If you encounter \"LinAlgError\", you can mitigate your number/array by summing a small value before taking the operation, e.g. np.linalg.inv($\\Sigma_k$ + SIGMA_CONST). You can arrest and handle such error by using [Try and Exception Block](https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/#the-try-and-except-block-handling-exceptions) in Python.Please only add `SIGMA_CONST` when `sigma_i` is not invertible. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In the above calculation, you must avoid computing a $(N,N)$ matrix. Using the above equation for large N will crash your kernel and/or give you a memory error on Gradescope. Instead, you can do this same operation by calculating $(X-\\mu)\\Sigma^{-1}$, a $(N,D)$ matrix, transpose it to be a $(D,N)$ matrix and do an element-wise multiplication with $(X-\\mu)^T$, which is also a $(D,N)$ matrix. Lastly, you will need to sum over the 0 axis to get a $(1,N)$ matrix before proceeding with the rest of the calculation. This uses the fact that doing an element-wise multiplication and summing over the 0 axis is the same as taking the diagonal of the $(N,N)$ matrix from the matrix multiplication. \n",
    "- In Numpy implementation for each individual $\\mu$, you can either use a 2-D array with dimension $(1,D)$ for each Gaussian Distribution, or a 1-D array with length $D$. Same to other array parameters. Both ways should be acceptable but pay attention to the shape mismatch problem and be **consistent all the time** when you implement such arrays. \n",

In fact, you can successfully solve the problem by simply modifying the call and _init_components methods.)"
