To perform image compression, apply SVD on each matrix and get rid of the small singular values to compress the image. The loss of information through this process is negligible, and the difference between the images can be hardly spotted. \n",

    "[Principal Component Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) (PCA) is another dimensionality reduction technique that reduces dimensions by eliminating small variance eigenvalues and their vectors. With PCA, we center the data first by subtracting the mean. Each singular value tells us how much of the variance of a matrix (e.g. image) is captured in each component. In this problem, we will investigate how PCA can be used to improve features for regression and classification tasks and how the data itself affects the behavior of PCA.  \n",

    "Feature selection is an integral aspect of machine learning. It is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features that are to be used as the input for the machine learning task. Feature selection may lead to simpler models for easier interpretation, shorter training times, avoidance of the curse of dimensionality, and better generalization by reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the <strong>feature_reduction.py</strong> file, complete the following functions:  \n",
    "  * <strong>forward_selection</strong>\n",
    "  * <strong>backward_elimination</strong>\n",
    "  \n",
    "These functions should each output a list of features. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forward Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "In forward selection, we start with a null model, start fitting the model with one individual feature at a time, and select the feature with the minimum p-value. We continue to do this until we have a set of features where one feature's p-value is less than the confidence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to implement it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a significance level (given to you).\n",
    "2. Fit all possible simple regression models by considering one feature at a time.\n",
    "3. Select the feature with the lowest p-value.\n",
    "4. Fit all possible models with one extra feature added to the previously selected feature(s).\n",
    "5. Select the feature with the minimum p-value again. if p_value < significance, go to Step 4. Otherwise, terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Backward Elimination:\n",
    "\n",
    "In backward elimination, we start with a full model, and then remove the insignificant feature with the highest p-value (that is greater than the significance level). We continue to do this until we have a final set of significant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to implement it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a significance level (given to you).\n",
    "2. Fit a full model including all the features.\n",
    "3. Select the feature with the highest p-value. If (p-value > significance level), go to Step 4, otherwise terminate.\n",
    "4. Remove the feature under consideration.\n",
    "5. Fit a model without this feature. Repeat entire process from Step 3 onwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "TIP 1: The p-value is known as the observed significance value for a null hypothesis. In our case, the p-value of a feature is associated with the hypothesis $H_{0}\\colon \\beta_j = 0$. If $\\beta_j = 0$, then this feature contributes no predictive power to our model and should be dropped. We reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is smaller than our significance level. Some more information about p-values can be found here: https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-a-p-value-b9e6c207247f\n",
    "\n",
    "TIP 2: For this function, you will have to install statsmodels if not installed already. To do this, run `pip install statsmodels` in command line/terminal. In the case that you are using an Anaconda environment, run `conda install -c conda-forge statsmodels` in the command line/terminal. For more information about installation, refer to https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/install.html. The statsmodels library is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration. You will have to use this library to choose a regression model to fit your data against. Some more information about this module can be found here: https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "TIP 3: For step 2 in each of the forward and backward selection functions, you can use the `sm.OLS` function as your regression model. Also, do not forget to add a bias to your regression model. A function that may help you is the `sm.add_constants` function.\n",

    "TIP 4: You should be able to implement these function using only the libraries provided in the cell below."
