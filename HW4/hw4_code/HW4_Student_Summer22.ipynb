It is one datapoint with $d$ features. $\\theta_{i} \\in R^{d}$ is the weight vector for the $i^{th}$ hidden unit, $b_{i} \\in R$ is the bias element for the $i^{th}$ hidden unit and $\\phi(.)$ is a non-linear activation function that has been described below. $u_{i}$ is a linear combination of the features in $x_j$ weighted by $\\theta_{i}$ whereas $o_{i}$ is the $i^{th}$ output unit from the activation layer. \n",

    "## Fully connected Layer\n",
    "Typically, a modern neural network contains millions of perceptrons as the one shown in the previous image. Perceptrons interact in different configurations such as cascaded or parallel. In this part, we describe a fully connected layer configuration in a neural network which comprises multiple parallel perceptrons forming one layer. \n",

    "### Relu and Leaky Relu\n",
    "The rectified linear unit (Relu) is one of the most commonly used activation functions in deep learning models. The mathematical form is $$o = \\phi(u) = max(0,u)$$One of the advantages of Relu is that it is a fast nonlinearity. <br> The derivative of relu function is given as $o' = \\phi'(u) = \\begin{cases}\n",

    "Leaky ReLU is a type of activation function based on a ReLU. The difference is that it has a small slope for negative values instead of a flat slope. The slope coefficient is determined before training. Leaky relu is a popular solution for sparse gradients, for example training generative adversarial networks.\n",

    "Tanh also known as hyperbolic tangent is like a shifted version of sigmoid activation function with its range going from -1 to 1. Tanh almost always proves to be better than the sigmoid function since the mean of the activations are closer to zero. Tanh has an effect of centering data that makes learning for the next layer a bit easier. The mathematical form of tanh is given as $$o = \\phi(u) = tanh(u) = \\frac{e^{u} - e^{-u}}{e^{u} + e^{-u}}$$ The derivative of tanh is given as $$o' = \\phi'(u) = 1 - {\\left(\\frac{e^{u} - e^{-u}}{e^{u} + e^{-u}}\\right)}^{2} = 1 - o^{2}$$\n",

    "### Sigmoid\n",
    "The sigmoid function is another non-linear function with S-shaped curve. This function is useful in the case of binary classification as its output is between 0 and 1.

    "## 3.3 Plotting Feature Importance [5pts Bonus for All] <span style=\"color:green\">**[W]**</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "While building tree-based models, it's common to quantify how well splitting on a particular feature in a decision tree helps with predicting the target label in a dataset. Machine learning practicioners typically use \"Gini importance\", or the (normalized) total reduction in entropy brought by that feature to evaluate how important that feature is for predicting the target variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gini importance is typically calculated as the reduction in entropy from reaching a split in a decision tree weighted by the probability of reaching that split in the decision tree. Sklearn internally computes the probability for reaching a split by finding the total number of samples that reaches it during the training phase divided by the total number of samples in the dataset. This weighted value is our feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about what this metric means with an example. A high probabiity of reaching a split on \"Age\" in a decision tree trained on our patient dataset (many samples will reach this split for a decision) and a large reduction in entropy from splitting on \"Age\" will result in a high feature importance value for \"Age\". This could mean \"Age\" is a very important feature for predicting a patients probability of disease. On the other hand, a low probability of reaching a split on \"Cholesterol (chol)\" in a decision tree (few samples will reach this split for a decision) and a low reduction in entropy from splitting on \"Cholesterol (chol)\" will result in a low feature importance value. This could mean \"Cholesterol (chol)\" is not a very informative feature for predicting a patients probability of disease in our decision tree. **Thus, the higher the feature importance value, the more important the feature is to predicting the target label.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately for us, fitting a sklearn.DecisionTreeClassifier to a dataset auomatically computes the Gini importance for every feature in the decision tree and stores these values in a **feature\\_importances\\_** variable. [Review the docs for more details on how to access this variable](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.feature_importances_)\n",
