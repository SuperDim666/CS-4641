        1. Batch GD loops over all mini batches in the dataset one by one and learns a gradient 
        2. One iteration here is one round of forward and backward propagation on one minibatch. 
           You will use self.iter and self.batch_size to index into x and y to get a batch. This batch will be
           fed into the forward and backward functions.

           **For LOCAL TEST append the y batched array at every iteration instead of every 1000th multiple

        5. We expect a noisy plot since learning on a batch adds variance to the
